# Unreal Engine - First Person Shooter MiniGame

In this project, I have created a simple FPS mini game using Unreal Engine's Blueprint system. 

Functionalities covered in this project include:

An FPS player controller with the ability to move, look, jump and shoot.
Enemies with simple AI who can navigate around obstacles, chase and attack the player.
The enemies were also animated with a state machine created in the animation editor.
Also used the UI editor to create a health bar and ammo text.
Also made use of an Actor to create a health pickup for the player.

## Description

After executing the .exe file, the game boots up. 

You will be immediatly loaded into the only level of the game. 

Enemies will start to chase and follow the player, attacking when they are in close distance. 

When the player health reaches 0, the level will be reset automatically.

The objecitve of the game is to eliminate all of the enemies with the limited amount of ammo that the player starts with. 

### Controls

For Player Movement you can use the:

W - Moves the player Forward;
S - Moves the player Backward;
A - Moves the player to the Left;
D - Moves the player to the Right;

SPACE - Makes the player jump upward;

Mouse Left Click - The player shoots the gun;

Move Mouse Around - Rotates the player rotation and look angle with respect to the mouse movement.
